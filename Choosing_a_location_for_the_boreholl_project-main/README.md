# Choosing_a_location_for_the_boreholl_project


We need to decide where to drill a new well for GlavRosGosNeft.
The steps for choosing a location are usually as follows:
In the chosen region, they collect characteristics for the wells: the quality of oil and the volume of its reserves;
They build a model to predict the amount of reserves in new wells;
Select the wells with the highest value estimates;
Identify the region with the maximum total return of the selected wells.
You are provided with oil samples from three regions. The characteristics for each well in the region are already known. Construct a model to determine the region where production is most profitable. Analyze the possible profits and risks using the Bootstrap technique.

  f0, f1, f2 — три признака точек (неважно, что они означают, но сами признаки значимы);
