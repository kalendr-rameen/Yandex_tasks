# Determining_patterns_for_successful_game

Historical data on game sales, user and expert evaluations, genres and platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation) are available from open sources. We need to identify the patterns that determine the success of a game. This will allow you to bet on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.
We have the data in front of us through 2016. Let's imagine it's December 2016 and we're planning a campaign for 2017. You need to work out how to work with the data. It doesn't matter if you're forecasting sales for 2017 based on 2016 data or 2027 based on 2026 data.

In the data set comes the acronym ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board), which is the association that determines the age rating of computer games. The ESRB evaluates game content and assigns it an appropriate age category, such as "For Adults," "For Young Children," or "For Teens."
