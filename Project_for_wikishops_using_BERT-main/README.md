# Project_for_wikishops

The online store "Wikishop" launches a new service. Now users can edit and supplement product descriptions, just like in wiki communities. That is, customers offer their edits and comment on others' changes. The store needs a tool that will look for toxic comments and send them for moderation.
We'll train the model to classify comments into positive and negative. We have a data set with markup about the toxicity of edits.


```
The text column in it contains the text of the comment, and toxic contains the target attribute.
```
