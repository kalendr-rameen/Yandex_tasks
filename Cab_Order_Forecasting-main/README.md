# Cab_Order_Forecasting

Taxi company has compiled historical data on cab orders at airports. To attract more drivers at peak times, you need to predict the number of cab orders for the next hour. We need to build a model for this prediction.

```
The number of orders is in the 'num_orders' column (from the number of orders).
```
